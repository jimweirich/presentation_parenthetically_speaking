From SICP, Section 3.1, footnote 11:

In view of this, it is ironic that introductory programming is most
often taught in a highly imperative style. This may be a vestige of a
belief, common throughout the 1960s and 1970s, that programs that call
procedures must inherently be less efficient than programs that
perform assignments. (Steele (1977) debunks this argument.)
Alternatively it may reflect a view that step-by-step assignment is
easier for beginners to visualize than procedure call. Whatever the
reason, it often saddles beginning programmers with ``should I set
this variable before or after that one'' concerns that can complicate
programming and obscure the important ideas.
